\chapter{Semi Automatic Annotation} \label{chapter:semi_automatic}

To assist the process of manual image annotation presented in chapter \ref{chapter:image_pose_annotation}, a neural network is to be developed to suggest poses. A neural network requires proper configuration and expertise to train it. This chapter describes the network architecture and its variations, as well as different approaches to train the network and the modified annotation process resulting from the usage of the network.

\section{Terminology}

\section{Network Architecture}

The architecture of the network is adapted to the problem specific to the medical images.

% Problem is reduced because segmentation masks are given

% Pipline overview

% ResNet architecture and the different flavors of the network

% Setup and implementation

\section{Methods}

% Describe the two different approachs of training the network

% Describe the whole workflow of annotating images using the program
% and then training the network / predicting poses

\subsection{Training from Scratch}

\subsection{Incremental Training}

\subsection{Inference}

% Manual inference for large batches

% Inference in the program
