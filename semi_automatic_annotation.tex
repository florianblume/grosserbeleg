\chapter{Semi Automatic Annotation} \label{chapter:semi_automatic}

To assist the process of manual image annotation presented in chapter \ref{chapter:image_pose_annotation}, a neural network is to be developed to suggest poses. Those poses can then be refined by the user using the annotation tool. This chapter describes the network architecture and its variations, as well as the modified annotation process that incorporates the network.

\section{Network Architecture}

% Definitions

% Pipline overview

% ResNet architecture and the different flavors of the network

\section{Methods}

% Describe the two different approachs of training the network

% Describe the whole workflow of annotating images using the program
% and then training the network / predicting poses
