\chapter{Experiments} \label{chapter:experiments}

The following section describes the setups of the experiments conducted with the neural network in chapter \ref{chapter:semi_automatic}. Due to the lack of existing annotated medical data the focus of the experiments is to ascertain a network design and operation that compensate this as best as possible. First, the different variations of the ResNet \cite{resnet} architecture are trialed. After choosing an architecture as the basis, based on a certain criterion, the network's accuracy is evaluated on different training schemes.

\section{Datasets}

% Describe T-Less -> argue why this was the chosen dataset

% Mention why not medical images

\section{Training}

% Explain setups and different training parameters / network architectures
