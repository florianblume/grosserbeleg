\chapter{Introduction}

About three decades ago, the first minimally invasive surgery was accomplished. This was a huge success, as minimally invasive surgery offers several advantages compared to the traditional open surgery, such as less pain for the patients and less time to stay in hospital afterwards \cite{minimallyinvasive}. Since then, a lot of things have changed. With the progress in the development of technology it became more and more feasible to assist surgeons with this kind of operations, as they are more complex and take longer to master than former methods.
