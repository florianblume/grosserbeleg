    \caption{The different architectures used in the experiments of Chapter \ref{chapter:experiments}.Architectures 1 and 3 use the leftmost structure with a total of 23 convolutional layers. We constructed architecture 2 using the layout in the middle with 35 layers. Architectures 4, 5 and 6 use the 50 layers structured as shown on the right, although architectures 4 and 6 employ dropout layers with different frequencies after each block and omit the batchnormalization layers. We omitted the batchnormalization layers in the other to structures for displaying purposes. Own image.}
